 You want to add a feature to see the times in a day when everyone is available.
To do this, you’ll need to know when any team is having a meeting.
In HiCal, a meeting is stored as tuples of integers (start_time, end_time).
These integers represent the number of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
   (2, 3) # meeting from 10:00 – 10:30 am
   (6, 9) # meeting from 12:00 – 1:30 pm
